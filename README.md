# Welcome to your Expo app üëã

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

## üöÄ How to use

```sh
#Download Expo Go app from App Store or Google Play if you're a green texter
npx create-expo-app -e with-router #Don't know if you have to do this since I already did it
npx expo start #This will start up expo Go, then scan the QR code with your Expo GO App
#If this says "There was a problem loading the requested app then do npm i -g expo-cli, and then expo-cli start --tunnel //MIGHT BE DEPRECATED IF IT'S DEPRECATED GOOD LUCK
#npm i should include stuff like react-native@0.74.2 axios react-native-dotenv
#make sure you cd into wordleHints (spelled correctly) from GitHub/worldeHints (spelled incorrectly- toooootally on purpose). worldeHints/wordleHints. It doesn't want me to rename the file it's in sorry
